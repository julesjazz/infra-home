# infra-home
A template repo for home infrastructure projects.
- container templates for re-use across projects
- home automation and LLM projects
- k8s learning opportunities
- cicd learning and general methods experimentation

# Notice
This is public to take advantage of some github resources. Further spawned projects will be homed in private repos on other accounts. 

## LLM
LLM assistance is being used for guidance and best practice.  
Methods in here are my own tested interpretation of public and open source methods as I find and adapt them.
